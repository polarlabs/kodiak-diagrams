# Diagrams detailing Kodiak's project and system

A diagram is worth a thousand words. The following diagrams, powered by [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)[^1], 
guide the Kodiak project and its implementation.

[Project's structure](PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md)

[System architecture](SYSTEM-ARCHITECTURE.md)

[Entityâ€“relationship model (ER model)](ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP-MODEL.md)

[Database schema](DATABASE-SCHEMA.md)

[^1]: By the way, for all of you who wonder how we create the diagrams have a look at [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/).
      Simply embed the *mermaid* code as a code block in your markdown file. GitHub will render the diagrams for you.
